# Pygame-DnD

This Python code creates a basic game with menus and adjustable settings using the Pygame library. It imports modules, initializes the Pygame window, defines RGB color values, creates two menu objects, and handles display functions. The main game loop runs continuously until the user exits, handling events like window resizing, key presses, and menu interactions. The main function initializes the Pygame environment.

# About

This Python code creates a basic game with menus and adjustable settings using the Pygame library. It imports modules from Pygame and Python's standard library, as well as some hand-made files for menu functionality. The screen setup initializes the Pygame window with specified width and height, sets the window title, creates a clock object for managing frame rates, and sets the initial display. RGB color values are defined for convenience. Two menu objects (mainMenu and playerSheet) are created for managing game menus. Display functions adjust brightness and handle settings like frame rate and volume. The main game loop runs continuously until the user exits, handling events like window resizing, key presses, and menu interactions.

# Features

Pygame is a Python library that allows developers to create basic games with menus and adjustable settings. It offers cross-platform compatibility across different platforms like Windows, macOS, and Linux, allowing developers to create games that can run on various operating systems. Pygame provides tools for drawing graphics, creating sprites, and handling images, allowing developers to easily render shapes, textures, and animations on the screen. It also supports sound effects and music playback, allowing developers to add audio elements to enhance the gaming experience.
Input device management is another key feature of Pygame, as it manages user input from devices like keyboards, mice, and joysticks. The event handling system allows developers to respond to user actions and manage game events. Pygame simplifies collision detection, making it essential for gameplay.
Performance optimization features include managing frame rates, minimizing resource usage, and improving rendering speed. Pygame is an accessible library for creating 2D games, making it an ideal choice for both beginners and experienced developers.

# Rating

The code is well-structured with clear sections for initialization, menu setup, display functions, and the game loop, making it easy to understand and modify. It provides basic functionality for managing menus, adjusting settings, and handling user input. Variable names are descriptive and provided with comments for readability. The code appears efficient in terms of resource usage and execution speed. However, it could be improved by adding more gameplay features or expanding the game's scope.
